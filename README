CS241 washing machine project


TODO:

I'd like everyone to write the module headers here in the following format, that will make it easier to keep track of everything.
FORMAT:
<Module_name> (<inputs>,<outputs>) [<NAME> <Status>]
	main bus in should be labeled bus_in, 
	specific inputs should be labeled accordingly
	main bus out should be labeled bus_out,
	specific outoput should be labeled accordingly
	
	name_of_signal = description of siganl
	name_of_bus = number of bits in bus, description

 
BINto7seg_decoder (nikita) done
washing_machine (Jason)
wash_control (bus_in,bus_out,timer_bus,stage_bus) [JASON, IN PROGRESS]
	bus_in = 9 bit, human input from wash machine
	bus_out= 6 bit, motor,valve,alert control
	timer_bus=4bit, timer display control
	stage_bus=4bit, stage display control
