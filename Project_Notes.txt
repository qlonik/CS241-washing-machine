/*
* start, clock, reset, cold, warm, hot, and extra_rinse are input buttons
* full, and empty are the sensors
* timer_bus is a 4 bit bus (0 to 15) holding the counter value, they will be passed to a binary to 7 seg
* 	 decoder.
* stage_bus is a 4 bit bus (0 to 12) holding what stage the wash is on currently, will also be passed to
*	a binary to 7 seg decoder
